\title{Single Sample Prediction for m6A Sites}
\usage{
prediction_single(
  ml_fit,
  gc_content,
  RNA_type,
  RNA_region,
  exon_length,
  distance_to_junction,
  evolutionary_conservation,
  DNA_5mer,
  positive_threshold = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ml_fit}{A trained machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) for predicting m6A sites.}

\item{gc_content}{A numeric value for the GC content of the sample.}

\item{RNA_type}{A character string specifying the RNA type. One of: "mRNA", "lincRNA", "lncRNA", "pseudogene".}

\item{RNA_region}{A character string specifying the RNA region. One of: "CDS", "intron", "3'UTR", "5'UTR".}

\item{exon_length}{A numeric value for the length of the exon in the sample.}

\item{distance_to_junction}{A numeric value for the distance to the nearest junction.}

\item{evolutionary_conservation}{A numeric value for the evolutionary conservation score of the region.}

\item{DNA_5mer}{A character string representing the 5-mer DNA sequence.}

\item{positive_threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1, used to classify the predicted m6A status as "Positive"
if the probability is greater than the threshold (default is 0.5).}
}
\value{
A named vector with two elements: "predicted_m6A_prob" (the predicted probability of m6A)
and "predicted_m6A_status" (either "Positive" or "Negative" based on the threshold).
}
\description{
This function takes individual feature values and uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the
m6A probability and status for a single sample. It calls the \code{prediction_multiple} function with a one-row data frame
and returns the predicted values as a named vector.
}
\examples{
ml_fit <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "rf_fit.rds", package="m6APrediction"))
prediction_single(ml_fit, gc_content = 0.6, RNA_type = "mRNA", RNA_region = "CDS",
                  exon_length = 12, distance_to_junction = 5, evolutionary_conservation = 0.8,
                  DNA_5mer = "ATCGAT", positive_threshold = 0.5)
